        title: "Advanced JavaScript",
        content: "This lesson explores three core concepts of advanced JavaScript: Closures, Promises, and Async/Await. Closures give you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. Promises are used for asynchronous computations, representing a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never. Async/Await is modern syntax that makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code, which makes it easier to read and write."

    "python-for-data-science": {
        title: "Python for Data Science",
        content: "Data science in Python is powered by libraries like NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation (using its famous DataFrame), and Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. These tools form the foundation of most data analysis and machine learning work in Python."

    "modern-css-techniques": {
        title: "Modern CSS Techniques",
        content: "Modern CSS has moved beyond simple selectors and properties. Today, powerful layout tools like Flexbox (for one-dimensional layouts) and CSS Grid (for two-dimensional layouts) are essential. Additionally, CSS Custom Properties (often called CSS Variables) allow you to store values for reuse throughout your stylesheet, making themes and large-scale changes much easier to manage."
